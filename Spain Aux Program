Spain’s Auxiliares de Conversación is open to American passport holders between 18 and 60 who have graduated from a bachelors or associates degree or are in their last year of education. 

You’re paid a salary and work 12 – 16 hours per week in a Spanish school as an English language assistant. You’ll also teach students about American culture.

The salary amounts to roughly 1000 euros per month. I've read this is adequate for basic necessities.

This is considered a student visa, so it does count towards half time (1 year = 6 months for citizenship/permanent residency purposes) for citizenship or permanent residency but I’ve heard that there’s such a demand for this program that they only let you do it for 3 years.
