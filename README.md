# Teacher-Assistant-in-Spain-Visa

The Spanish government hires American teacher assistants every year to help out in their classrooms. Teacher assisants must have a degree (associates or bachelors) or be in the last year of a degree program and be US citizens. 

You get a student visa which allows you to live and work at the school. You'll work about 12 - 16 hours per week and receive a salary of approximately 1000 euros per month.
