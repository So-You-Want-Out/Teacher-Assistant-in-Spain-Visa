The Spanish government hires American teacher assistants every year to help out in their classrooms. Teacher assisants must have a degree (associates or bachelors) or be in the last year of a degree program and be US citizens. 

You get a student visa which allows you to live in Spain and work at the school. You'll work about 12 - 16 hours per week and receive a salary of approximately 1000 euros per month.

Spain’s Auxiliares de Conversación is open to American passport holders between 18 and 60 who have graduated from a bachelors or associates degree or are in their last year of education. 

You’re paid a salary and work 12 – 16 hours per week in a Spanish school as an English language assistant. You’ll also teach students about American culture.

The salary amounts to roughly 1000 euros per month. I've read this is adequate for basic necessities.

This is considered a student visa, so it does count towards half time (1 year = 6 months for citizenship/permanent residency purposes) for citizenship or permanent residency but I’ve heard that there’s such a demand for this program that they only let you do it for 3 years. You must have spent 5 years in Spain to be eligible for permentant residency or citizenship, so using this program alone you'd need to spend 10 years in the country.
